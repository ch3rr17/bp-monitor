# Blood Pressure Monitor

A simple React + TypeScript application to track blood pressure readings.

## Features
- **Entry Form**: Capture Systolic and Diastolic numbers. Date/Time is automatically recorded.
- **List View**: View history of readings, grouped by Date and split into AM/PM columns.
- **Sorting**: Most recent entries appear at the top.
- **Modern UI**: Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Setup and Run

### Development Mode

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the backend server (in one terminal):
   ```bash
   npm run dev:server
   ```

3. Start the frontend dev server (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   http://localhost:5173

The Vite dev server will proxy API requests to the backend server on port 3000.

### Production Build

1. Build the React app:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production npm run server
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   http://localhost:3000
