# Blood Pressure Monitor

A simple React + TypeScript application to track blood pressure readings.

## Features
- **Entry Form**: Capture Systolic and Diastolic numbers. Date/Time is automatically recorded.
- **List View**: View history of readings, grouped by Date and split into AM/PM columns.
- **Sorting**: Most recent entries appear at the top.
- **Modern UI**: Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Setup and Run

### Development Mode

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the backend server (in one terminal):
   ```bash
   npm run dev:server
   ```

3. Start the frontend dev server (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   http://localhost:5173

The Vite dev server will proxy API requests to the backend server on port 3000.

### Production Build

1. Build the React app:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production npm run server
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   http://localhost:3000

## Structure
- `server.ts`: Express backend with REST API endpoints (TypeScript).
- `src/`: React application source code.
  - `components/`: React components (Index, AddEntry).
  - `api.ts`: API client functions.
  - `types.ts`: TypeScript type definitions.
  - `App.tsx`: Main React application component.
  - `main.tsx`: React entry point.
  - `index.css`: Tailwind CSS with custom theme.
- `dist/`: Built React application (generated by `npm run build`).
- `bp_readings.db`: SQLite database file (created automatically).

## Deployment to Vercel

📖 **For detailed step-by-step instructions, see [VERCEL_DEPLOY.md](./VERCEL_DEPLOY.md)**

### Quick Overview

1. **Push code to GitHub**
2. **Import repository in Vercel Dashboard**
3. **Create Blob Storage** (for data persistence)
4. **Add environment variable** (`BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`)
5. **Deploy!**

### Important Notes

✅ **Database Storage**: The SQLite database is automatically synced to **Vercel Blob Storage** for data persistence.

**Setup Required:**
1. Create a Blob Storage in your Vercel project (Storage tab → Create Database → Blob)
2. Add `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` environment variable in Vercel project settings
3. The database will automatically sync to Blob Storage after each write operation

This ensures your data persists across deployments and function invocations.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Backend**: Express.js (serverless functions on Vercel), SQLite3, Moment.js
- **Build Tools**: Vite, PostCSS, TypeScript
- **Deployment**: Vercel
